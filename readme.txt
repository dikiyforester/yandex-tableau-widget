The Yandex Tableau Widget plugin allows to customize your WordPress site representation on the Yandex.Browser Tableau.

== Description ==

The Tableau is a component of Yandex.Browser that displays favorite and frequently visited websites as visual bookmarks with the logo, site name, and additional notifiers.

Webmasters can use this plugin to customize their WordPress site widget by setting the background color and choosing a logo instead of the favicon that is used by default.

The API also allows displaying notifiers on the visual bookmark, to give users additional information. In the next release is planned to add two notifier:
